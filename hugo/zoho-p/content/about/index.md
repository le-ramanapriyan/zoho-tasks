# About Us

---

For more than 25 years, we've been bucking Silicon Valley trends, taking our own approach to building products.

## Good software is a work of art, and good art takes time.

Our teams spend years mastering their craft in order to deliver exceptional products that customers love. Software isn't just our paycheck:

It's our passion.

### Cutting-edge technology meets timeless values

We believe that software is the ultimate product of the hands and the mind. And we take pride in creating products and solutions that help solve business problems, anticipate needs, and discover opportunities to help you grow.

Over the past 25 years, we've brought more than 55 products to the market. But, the R&D edge that drives this innovation isn't simple luck; it's the result of careful choice.

We prefer to build things ourselves instead of growing our platform through acquisition. We invest more in customer support and product development than in sales and marketing. All that because we believe that's the best way to deliver choice and value to our customers.

This kind of thinking isn't innovative. But in today's business climate, it is increasingly rare.
